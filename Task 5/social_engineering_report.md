## Research Report: Social Engineering Attacks in the Modern Era.

**Subject:** Evaluation of Psychological Cyber Threats 
and Defensive Approaches.

### 1. Overview of Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering refers to techniques used to **influence and deceive individuals** into revealing sensitive information. Instead of exploiting technical weaknesses in systems, these attacks target the **human factor**. Cybercriminals take advantage of psychological cues—such as fear, urgency, trust, or curiosity—to persuade users to ignore or bypass security measures.

#### Core Attack Vectors

* **Phishing:**
  The most widespread attack method, involving fraudulent emails or messages. Attackers pretend to be trusted sources (such as banks, coworkers, or service providers) to convince victims to click harmful links or open infected attachments.

* **Pretexting:**
  This technique involves inventing a believable story or role. Attackers often impersonate auditors, HR staff, or IT support personnel to gain trust and collect sensitive details like personal identification numbers or internal login credentials.

* **Baiting:**
  Similar to phishing, but relies on offering something appealing to the victim.

  * *Digital:* A “free” or upgraded version of software that secretly includes malware.
  * *Physical:* A compromised USB drive labeled “Employee Bonuses” placed in a workplace parking area.

* **Vishing & Smishing:**
  These attacks are carried out through phone calls (voice phishing) and text messages (SMS phishing). Their use has increased significantly with advancements in AI-based voice cloning technologies.

### 2. Case Studies and Organizational Impact

Recent real-world events show that even organizations with strong technical defenses can fall victim to social engineering.

| Organization                             | Year | Method                      | Impact                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UK Retailers (e.g., Marks & Spencer)** | 2025 | **Help Desk Pretexting**    | Attackers associated with Scattered Spider impersonated IT staff to bypass MFA, resulting in losses of approximately **£300 million**. |
| **Coinbase**                             | 2025 | **Insider Bribery**         | Criminal groups bribed customer support employees to expose user data, with potential damages reaching **hundreds of millions**.       |
| **Japan (CoGUI Campaign)**               | 2025 | **Large-Scale Phishing**    | Roughly 580 million fraudulent emails mimicked major brands like Amazon and PayPal to steal login credentials.                         |
| **LexisNexis**                           | 2024 | **Pretexted GitHub Access** | Social engineering tactics were used to access development systems, exposing information of **364,000 individuals**.                   |

### 3. Prevention and Mitigation Recommendations

Protecting against social engineering requires a **people-centered security approach** supported by strong technical safeguards.

#### Organizational Recommendations

1. **Ongoing Security Awareness Training (SAT):**
   Shift from annual training videos to frequent simulations. Regular mock phishing exercises help employees develop awareness and healthy skepticism.

2. **Strict Verification Procedures:**
   Apply Zero Trust principles to sensitive actions. Requests such as wire transfers or password resets should always be confirmed through a separate, trusted communication channel.

3. **Advanced MFA Solutions (FIDO2/WebAuthn):**
   Traditional SMS or app-based MFA methods can be exploited through phishing or push fatigue. Hardware-based security keys (e.g., Yubico) provide the strongest protection.

4. **AI-Driven Email Filtering:**
   Use machine learning tools to identify unusual sender behavior and language patterns that may signal spear-phishing or deepfake-based attacks.

#### Individual Best Practices

* **Pause Before Acting:**
  Social engineers depend on urgency. If a message pressures you to act quickly, it may be fraudulent.
* **Check Links Carefully:**
  Always inspect the destination URL before clicking on any link.
* **Report Instead of Deleting:**
  Reporting suspicious emails helps IT teams prevent the threat from spreading across the organization.

### Summary

In 2026, social engineering continues to be the **primary entry point** for cyber intrusions. As artificial intelligence makes scams more realistic through flawless language and synthetic voices, effective defense depends on **awareness, caution, and strict compliance with security procedures**.
